## About

Speedrun Data is a Node.js app that can web-scrape any webpage from [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com) to display various information about the game's leaderboard.

## What it can do

Speedrun Data creates an Excel spreadsheet with all categories of a specified game with the **amount of runs** and **world record time (in ms)**

## How to install and use

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the program in releases page
3. Open command line in program's directory and type `npm install`
4. Run `run.bat` file or run `npm start` in the directory of a program
5. Enter a valid speedrun.com leaderboard link. It's best to remove all unnecessary things and enter it like this: `https://speedrun.com/game_name` where _game_name_ is the name of the game in URL
6. After it went through everything, you can exit the program by typing `exit`

### P. S.

the code is messy and stuff and i made it for myself really so if there is something you find unconvinient in this program, i'm sorry. not like anyone needs it though
